# Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The goal of this challenge is to provide ridesharing data visualizations for PyBer a ridesharing comapny, in order to promote access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underprivileged neighborhoods. In this project analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for Pyber CEO.
The study is based on data obtained in the form of a CSV file from PyBer. This data has been processed using Python's Pandas to produce a summary dataframe as well as a chart generated using the information in the dataframe to visualize the data.

# Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
